# BottleOfAllay
Storing Allays in glass bottles so they don't wander off aimlessly and get lost

- Allays can be right-clicked to trap them into a glass bottle and called "Bottle of Allay"
  - This may be bypassed by shifting
- The item they are carrying, their name, duplication delay, and their health will be stored in the bottle
- The Allay can be released by right-clicking a block
  - If the Allay was carrying an item, it will follow the player who released the Allay

# Other features
- You can drink the Bottle of Allay (as an act of cruelty) which will cause you to levitate for 30 seconds
  - The item that the Allay was carrying, if any, will drop (as if you burped it)
- You may give Bottles of Allay to other allays and bottle them.
  - A limit on how many recursions players can do this is configurable in the config.
  - WARNING: If this number is set too high, it is possible to create an item that will instantly kick players from servers.
